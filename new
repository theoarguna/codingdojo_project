git and GitHub
1) I made an account with GitHub
2) I created a local directory for my codingdojo project
3) I created a repository on github
	a) I named the repository codingdojo_project
		i) project is publically available on GitHub at theoarguna/codingdojo_project
4) I used the terminal to create a new repository, store a remote repository url and push it to said repository utilizing the following statements:
	touch README.md
	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote git remote add origin https://github.com/theoarguna/codingdojo_project.git
	git push -u origin master
5) I verified the README.md file I created was uploaded to the repository
